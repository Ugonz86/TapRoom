### Specs
```
As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see it's name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).

As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)

As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.

As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints).

As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.

As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.

As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.

As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
