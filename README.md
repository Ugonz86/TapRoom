Employee can fill out a form to add a new keg to the list.

New added orders will display when the keg was added.

Employee can edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case they make a mistake.

Employees can see how many pints are left on each keg. A full keg has roughly 124 pints.

Employees are able to click a button next to a keg whenever they sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
